This folder contains the python and R scripts used in my dissertation and the paper Spatial Structure Can Decrease Symbiotic Cooperation.

munge_data.py is a general script for taking data files, extracting the desired data points, and combining them into a single file with proper labels for my R scripts.

InitialStats is the R script for the first subsection, Figure 4.2 and Figure 4.3

GeneratingGraphs is the R script for the stacked area plots in Figure 4.4 and 4.5, 4.6 and 4.7

StartingConditionInitialStats is the R script for the line plots in section 4.3.4. Figure 4.8

TasksInitialGraphs and TasksBucketGraphs generate the graphs in section 4.4

SpatialBucketGraphs and SpatialInitialStats generate the graphs in section 4.5

simple_repeat.py can be used to run multiple replicates and treatments locally.

MOIAnalysis.R is in-progress and analyzes MOI and host survival over time.
